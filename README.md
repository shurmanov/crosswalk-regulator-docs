# Intro
This repository serves as a guide to all the code repositories of our Crosswalk Regulator Project(**CRP**) that we made during [Open Data Challenge Tashkent 2018 Hackathon](https://data.gov.uz/ru/challenge).

Briefly, our **Crosswalk Regulator Project** is a crosswalk rule violation detection system based on YOLOv3 real-time object detection with web interface.

Below, you can find brief description and links to the two main repositories of our Crosswalk Regulator Project.

## crosswalk-regulator-core(crc)
This is a core of our Crosswalk regulator project. For more info about the core, go [here](https://github.com/bedilbek/crosswalk-regulator-core).

## crosswalk-regulator-web(crw)
crosswalk-regulator-web serves as a web-interface for navigating the rule violations in the real-time. For more info about crw, go [here](https://github.com/shurmanov/crosswalk-regulator-web).
